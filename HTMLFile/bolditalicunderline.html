<b>LYRICS:</b><br><br>
<b>TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR</b><br><br>
<u>Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are. Up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky. </u>Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are.
When the blazing sun is set, and the grass with dew is wet. <b><u>Then you show your little
light</u></b>, twinkle, twinkle all the night. Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder what you
are.<br><br>
Then the traveler in the dark thanks you for your tiny spark. How could he see where to
go if you did not twinkle so? Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are.
<i>As your bright and tiny spark lights the traveler in the dark, though </i> I know not what you
are, twinkle, twinkle, little star. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are.</p>
